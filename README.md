# martinManleyMyLifeAndDeath
On 8-15-13, sports writer Martin Manley committed suicide. Before he did, he launched a website to be his legacy. 
However, yahoo took it down as a "violation of their terms of service". 

I feel that this is a disgrace to one man's legacy -- and, although I did not know him or know much about him, I feel 
that it is my ethical obligation to preserve that legacy.

"Anonymous" hackers managed to scrape the content from yahoo's servers before they were deleted completely. I have archived
here a copy of those files. 

Martin Manley, may you rest in peace.
