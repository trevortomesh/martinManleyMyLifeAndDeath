<p align="center">Greetings citizens of the world.
We are Anonymous.</p>
 
<p>On the 15th of August, a reporter by the named of Martin Manley decided to take his own life. Before doing so,
he decided to leave a memoir in the form of a website (http://martinmanleylifeanddeath.com). We encourage
all legion and citizens to view this site if they have not already. It is a in-depth look in to the mind
of a man who has lost hope and faith in this world.</p>
 
<p>As news of this memoir spread across mainstream news the website experienced heavy delays
and loads as Yahoo failed to compensate. Even now potential viewers are greeted
with a '503 error'.</p>
 
<p>Anonymous is many things. We are legion. We are empathetic towards all those who have lost faith
in the system that is constructed around us. We appreciate all offerings to the internet
as the internet is our home and domain. We are here to protect, contain and display
all information that can be progressive towards humanity.</p>
 
<p>We do not, however, condone suicide as means to right the wrongs of the system we live
in and we feel strongly for those who have lost in their lives because of it.</p>
 
<p>Anonymous has lost some of it's own to suicide. Lest we forget Aaron Schwartz.</p>
 
<p>Thus, we humbly offer a mirror for Martin Manley for all to view and research and
learn from. Please consider talking to a loved one before ending your own life.</p>
 
<p>We are all heroes in our own way.</p>
<p>Don't end your journey.</p>

<p>RIP Martin Manley</p>
<p>RIP Aaron Schwartz</p>
<p>RIP all fallen heroes</p>
 
<p>We are Anonymous.
We DO NOT forget.
We will not forgive.
We are legion.
Expect us.</p>
