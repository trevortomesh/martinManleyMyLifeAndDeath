font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>2</strong></span> It had always been an interesting phenomenon, I thought as I watched the game from the bleachers, how impressive <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;">3</span></strong> Shoeless Joe looked on the field below. Not just because he played for a great team – 107 wins and 43 losses, but because he never seemed to get <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>4</strong></span> dirty – not even his feet. Reaching over and taking<span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"> <strong>5</strong></span> Annie’s hand, I started to tell her again of the story almost four months ago, on Memorial Day when the spring rains typically threatened to wipe out a home game. She’d heard it before, but like the devoted wife of mine she was, she patiently sat at attention – always listening for some new tidbit she hadn’t heard before.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">I was watching our game against the Rebels that Memorial Day when a typical late-afternoon storm began to move in. It didn’t look particularly threatening, so I decided not to send <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>6</strong></span> Karin into the house. Besides, the game was a pitching masterpiece and no daughter of mine was going to miss it if I had anything to say about it. Even at nine years of age, she could appreciate how a well-placed curve ball would make even the best professional hitters look like nine-year old sandlot boys.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">The White Sox trailed 1-0 even though <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>7</strong></span> Claude “Lefty” Williams was pitching another gem. He had allowed only one base runner through nine innings – a lead-off double and two sacrifices in the fourth inning. Williams would have a perfect game going, but the left field umpire ruled the double, which Shoeless Joe tracked down, was a trap. Clearly it was caught. Everyone could plainly see he had the glove under the ball. But, old man <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>8</strong></span> Denky couldn’t see the nose on his face unless he painted it black first. Everyone knew it, but here he was still making crucial calls in close games!</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Leaning back on the bleachers and closing my eyes as though somehow I could recall better in the dark, I went on with the story… When the White Sox came to bat in the bottom of the ninth, the sky started getting dark and ugly. I reconsidered my decision to let Karin stay outside, but the game was… well, it was intoxicating. It was almost as though I knew something special was going to happen.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">It had been almost <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>9</strong></span> nine months since I completed the stadium, but we were only able to watch the last few weeks of the previous season and the first two months of this season. I was holding onto every minute – hoping to see as much magic from the White Sox as possible. No matter what, I didn’t want to miss a comeback because of some ominous clouds!</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>10</strong></span> Mark came running over and interrupted my story. “Ray! When the game is over”, he said, “I’ve got some good news for you.” He knew I didn’t like being interrupted and just because he was Annie’s brother didn’t make it any better. Once I started watching the Sox, my world was pretty much closed to outsiders. Even in retelling the story of a game back on <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;">11</span></strong> May 28th, I could barely also concentrate on the one taking place in front of me.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Annie had missed the game on Memorial Day because she thought it was better to spend some time with her family. Originally, they were skeptical about my baseball field and they sure didn’t believe I’d been told by some mysterious voice to build it! Another way of putting it is… they thought I was nuts – as did just about everyone in town. I never blamed them for it, but once they learned there were actually real games being played by real players, townies came flocking to see what the excitement was all about. Attendance had been steady at about 2,000 per game and I had to build new bleachers just to keep up. Even though they had come to realize something amazing was going on in a cornfield in Iowa, Annie’s family (except for Mark) tended to stay away. I think they were half confused and half embarrassed. Either way, Annie had to miss a game to see them and it just so happened to be on Memorial Day, 1990.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">I brushed Mark off, barely hearing what he said. Who knows what kind of “good news” he was referring to? Normally, I would have tackled him to make sure he told me on the spot, but this was during a White Sox game in September and during my retelling of another game in May. That’s a <em>real</em> double-header, I thought to myself!</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">“Go on”, Annie said, taking a step below me on the bleachers so she could look into my eyes. It reminded me briefly of how our whole relationship had changed since our daughter Karin <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>12</strong></span> fell off the same steps last year – just after I finished building them. Mark admits that day… that hour… that minute… changed his life – that it was a tipping point. Instead of being someone fixated on the bottom line, he realized life was anything but; life was something that floated majestically on the waves of destiny and we were all just along for the ride – going wherever the wind predetermined.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Mark comes to every home game. He usually sits over by left field shooting the bull with <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;">13</span></strong> Joe Jackson whenever a ball is hit near the foul line. Personally, I’ve never been able to leave the right side of the diamond. Sure, I built the entire stadium and all the magic that goes with it – even <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>14</strong></span> redemption. But, <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>15</strong></span> Doc Graham saved Karin’s life that day right at the foot of these very bleachers. How do you walk away from that?</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Besides, I always felt like right field was where I should be closest to. It was, after all, the Sox’ weakest spot on the team and I guess I felt like if I were closer to it, maybe it would make a difference. <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>16</strong></span> Nemo Leibold was the right fielder for the Sox in the 1919 World Series. He was one of three starting players <em>not</em> found guilty of throwing the Series. I guess that means he was a real <em>White</em> Sox rather than a <em>Black</em> Sox as the rest of the group had been labeled.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Leibold was pretty good, but he and the other <em>clean</em> Sox never showed up on my field. Maybe he just didn’t like corn. Who knows? As a result, the Sox had put up a number of replacement rejects in right field hoping for the best. Admittedly, when a team is as good as the Sox were this year, it didn’t matter much who was in right field. But, it mattered to me. I didn’t want to see them ever lose a single game!</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">“Go on”, Annie said again, interrupting my thought and pounding her fist on the top of my knee just to get my attention. Okay, so there we were watching this tense game. It was the bottom of the ninth and the Sox trailed 1-0. The Rebels were the defending champs and we had to expect to beat them – especially at home – or we weren’t going to win the pennant this year.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">In retrospect, I realize how silly I was then because now we led them by 14 games with only 12 to go, but at the time we were in a dead heat – tied for first place. Early in the season our pitching was great. We had 14 shutouts in 39 games and a good record of 24-15. But, our hitting was far from being what it needed to be. With the exception of Joe, no one was consistently contributing with the bat.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">In the ninth inning on that Memorial Day, Joe was coming up fourth in the order. I knew someone would have to get on base to give us a chance. <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>17</strong></span> Swede Risberg led off with a routine grounder to short. One up, one down. Next came <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>18</strong></span> Freddy McMullin. He hit a pop fly to second on a 2-0 count. I remember wondering why this guy was swinging. We need a base runner, for crying out loud, any way we can get one. Oh well, two up, two down.</span></p><p><br /><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;"> We were going to lose this game and any second Mother Nature was going to show us no respect by dumping on us. What a way to lose – because of a bad call by Denky. What a combination – Mother Nature and Don Denky. They should get married. Then, Mother Denky could wash the black off Don’s nose so that he could claim he didn’t have one.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Joe Jackson was, of course, suspended from the White Sox and the game of baseball in 1920 – the year after the World Series scandal. There are many who believe Jackson was never involved – that he simply said he was involved to avoid the pressure. <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>19</strong></span> Baseball historians point to the fact that Jackson’s batting average in the World Series was a stellar .375. He even hit the only home run in the entire eight-game series and he didn’t make a single error!</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Some argue that Jackson was successful at the plate only when it didn’t matter, but that argument has little merit. The fact is Jackson was semi-illiterate and may have been caught up in something he didn’t fully understand. It’s hard to believe he was smart enough to figure out when to get a hit and when not to. He simply played for the love of the game.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">When the Sox were behind four games to one in the best of nine in the 1919 World Series, it meant only one more loss would do the trick. In what could have been the deciding moment of the series, the Sox were tied with the Reds 4-4 in the 10th inning. One would think Jackson would have simply struck out. Instead he got a single and Chicago beat Cincinnati 5-4 to stay alive.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">The White Sox were on the ropes that game and the next two yet Jackson had two hits in each of the three games and was doing everything he could to win.</span></p><p> </p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;" valign="top" width="118" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><p> </p></td><td style="text-align: center;" valign="top" width="118" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><p align="center"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;

Nope, I didn’t believe he was guilty.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Besides, how could Jackson have thrown the series when he hit .375 while Nemo Leibold didn’t even get a slap on the wrist even though he was only one for 18 and batted .056?</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">“You’re daydreaming again”, Annie said with a bit of frustration. She was right, but I enjoyed it. Next up was the pitcher Lefty Williams and no one in their right mind would let him hit with the game on the line. He wasn’t as bad a hitter as he used to be, but I remember a <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>20</strong></span> stretch from 1917-1918 when he was 0/44! His last hit was a nubber. The only reason he reached first base is the opposing pitcher fell off the mound and couldn’t field it.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Hitting for Williams was a new kid the team had just acquired. He wasn’t very big, but he had a big heart. He wasn’t very fast, but he had a sixth sense - knowing when to run and when not to – or at least that’s what the folks from Ottumwa said about him. <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>21</strong></span> Ottumwa is just a couple hours south of here.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;">22</span></strong> W. E. Shaffer was about to get his first at-bat for the Sox. Walter Eugene was his real name, but everyone just called him “Corporal”. When he joined the team a few days earlier, Ray learned about the kid. It seems he had been in the National Guard after the Korean War and was playing for one of the local teams around Ottumwa when he was wrongly accused of killing a young girl. She fell or was pushed out of a window to her death and someone said he did it. Shaffer claimed he was innocent and no evidence was found to the contrary.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Even so, the girls’ father was rich and he wanted someone to pay. Shaffer wasn’t the kind of kid to put up too much resistance, so when pressed, he agreed to a compromise. Rather than going to trial before a jury, he accepted a discharge. That was in 1958. I don’t even know if the kid is dead or alive. All I know for sure is that his mother is a very old woman who lives in Ottumwa, but made the trip to my field just to get a chance to see her son play for the Sox.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Here he was, 26-years old and coming in to bat for Lefty Williams. I couldn’t help but notice how pudgy he looked for a ball player. The count went full before Walter even thought about swinging. He was a smart kid. With two outs in the ninth inning and down by a run and nobody on base, the only thing that mattered was getting on – and a walk would be just fine. He fouled off two more pitches just protecting the plate and then… ball four. I was thrilled. Joe was going to come up to bat.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">If we lost, we could at least say we had a chance to tie it. Ideally, of course, he would hit a screaming liner off the top of Dinky’s head for an inside the park homer, but that was dreaming. This was the first game Joe had been the lead-off hitter. As player-manager, he decided to bat first instead of third or fourth for a very logical reason. He told me, “If I bat first, I may come up one more time in a game. Since no one is getting on base in front of me anyway, I may as well try to drive myself in!” It was unorthodox, but it looked like a good move now.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Just as the pitcher delivered his first offering, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;">23</span></strong> Walter bolted back to the safety of first base, lightning struck out near <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;">24</span></strong> Eddie’s grave and Shoeless Joe whacked the ball to the gap. All in that order separated by about two seconds each.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Shaffer jumped to his feet and leapt off first base like a young bird just learning to fly. He started hustling toward second and so did his dog <strong>25</strong> Hook. Four months later, it’s become a common sight to see Hook run the bases with Corporal, but that was the first time I had ever seen a dog on the field – during live play.</span></p><p><br /><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;"> Suddenly, all hell broke loose. The thickest <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>26</strong></span> wall of water I’ve ever seen came down right on top of us. Karin snuggled under my jacket, Walter kept running, and the Rebels’ center fielder fell down. Shoeless Joe was gaining on Corporal. Hook was in doggie heaven running around the infield in the rain.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">I remember wondering for the briefest of moments why Corporal dove back to first when the pitch was to home. That could be a costly mistake since Joe was on top of him by the time they reached third base. The left fielder had retrieved the ball and was throwing to the cutoff man when the most amazing thing happened.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">After a pause, Annie said… “Bring it home, baby.” I just loved that. It had become our <em>thing</em>. I would pause in telling the story when both were at third base and she would call me “baby”. Actually, the “baby” part was a later add-on. She just wanted to hear herself say “Bring it home.” She thought she was being clever – home plate and all.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">I couldn’t believe my eyes, but Joe literally grabbed Walter in a bear hug and kept running for home. Thinking back on it, I can’t help but laugh – almost hysterically – seeing Corporal’s feet still running in mid air while Joe was the only one touching ground. I could hardly see through the rain, but I knew I was watching something incredible. I jerked my jacket off Karin and said… “Look, look, look!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">The ball was coming in from left field while Shoeless Joe Jackson was carrying Walter Eugene “Corporal” Shaffer toward home plate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Then, everything seemed to move in slow motion. I wiped my eyes and realized it was over. Just as the rain had come, it had gone – within seconds. The <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;">27</span></strong> sun was bursting through a hole in the clouds. Everything was suddenly so light, so bright, so clear.</span><br /> <br /><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;"> I could see there were four bodies piled at home plate and three of them human. The home plate umpire, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;">28</span></strong> Kenny Landers, held us all in suspense and then yelled “safe” – and then a second later yelled “safe” again! Wild jubilation swept the team. They were jumping up and down and rushing the field. Karin and I were jumping up and down. Hook was running around in circles doing what dogs do when confused – barking deliriously.</span></p><p><br /><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;"> We won 2-1 because Shoeless Joe hit a two-run inside-the-park homer in the bottom of the ninth inning with two outs… and he did it by literally carrying Corporal across home plate… and the Sox have been in first ever since. If you didn’t see it, you would never have believed it. But then the 1,300 paying fans at the game, most of who were still there, know it to be true. It’s just that none of them can tell the story the way I can. At least that’s what Annie says – and who could doubt her objectivity?</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Still, if I had to pick a single thing about the game that I can’t forget and can’t explain, it is that when all the players got done slapping each other’s butt and high fiving until their hands hurt, I noticed something…</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">…Shoeless Joe’s uniform was as clean as if it had just been washed. That didn’t seem possible. He dove for a ball - the so-called double - in the fourth inning and he crashed into home plate in the mud. I’m sure Hook jumped on him a time or two during the fracas. Yet, his uniform was as white as rice. I tried to see Corporal’s uniform, my <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;">29</span></strong> dad’s or any of the players, but they had their backs to me as they raced to the centerfield exit still cheering.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">“What do you think?” I said to Annie. “It gets better each time I hear it.” That’s something she said after every retelling. At some point, it can’t get any better – right? Is she a great wife or what? She went on… “I wonder if Eddie summoned the lightning and the storm if only for a few seconds. If that center fielder hadn’t slipped in the rain… well, who knows? We would have probably lost and not taken over first place. And, where would we be today?” Annie is a very thoughtful person. That ninth inning gave new life, a rebirth if you will - to this team. And, now we have clinched the pennant with two weeks to go.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Annie took my hand again and asked me to go see what Mark wanted. I told her he would be over soon since we had this game in the bag 7-2 with only one more inning to play. “Besides, I said, I just like sitting here in right field.” The truth is I don’t <em>like</em> it exactly, but I feel like this is where I belong. I <em>prefer</em> it. That sounds better. “I’m heading in” said Annie. “I’ll tell him you’re anxious to find out what he wants.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">I sat there watching the last inning calculating in my head. We were about to go to 108-43 with 11 games left. If we could win nine of them we would break the cross-town <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;">30</span></strong> Cubs’ record of 116 wins in 1906. Well, we wouldn’t exactly break it, we would <em>surpass</em> it, since… what makes a record official?</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">In any event, most of the players had been shooting for it since the pennant had been decided a couple weeks ago. The team was heading for a road trip later tonight for eight games. The final three would be at home – here in my ball park. I expected an overflow crowd for all three games and probably a new attendance record each day.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">It was asking a lot to win 9/11 when there was so little at stake. Yet, Shoeless Joe had been playing harder every day. It was as if he had prove that he was the best – that the Sox were the best… ever.</span></p><p style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"> </p><p style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Chapter 2 <br /></span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">I was still thinking about that Memorial Day comeback, the lightning striking out by Eddie’s grave and the new life it pumped into the team when Mark came running over. “Guess what?” he said breathlessly. “What”, I replied. Mark went on to tell me we had a new right fielder. Joe had told me before the game that <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>31</strong></span> Bump was history. His attitude was bad anyway. “The new guy is – are you ready for this – <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>32</strong></span> Eddie R. Hobbkus – another Eddie.” I couldn’t believe it, Hobbkus had been <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>33</strong></span> missing for… ever. “Who found him?” I asked. “<span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>34</strong></span> Salinger said he tracked him down in some little village in the Tibetan mountains – <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>35</strong></span> Ash-Laring or something like that. Anyway, Salinger says he’ll be with the Sox by the time they get back home for the three-game series with the Spoilers.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">I ran to tell Annie and Karin the news, but Mark had already beaten me to it. The four of us settled in and talked well into the night about that incredible year Hobbkus had in 1948 with the Cubs – although they were known as the <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>36</strong></span> “Knights” for that one season. <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>37</strong></span> One version has Hobbkus accused of selling his honor for money and kicked out of baseball. Another has him resisting the temptation and becoming a local hero. It was hard to know what was true and what was not. The only thing anyone knew for sure is that he’d been missing ever since. </span><br /> <br /><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;"> Salinger was taken by the story. He had researched it and had always doubted Hobbkus’ guilt. He believed he was being blackmailed into throwing a game for reasons he could only speculate upon. Rumor had it that one of Salinger’s fellow reporters – a certain <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>38</strong></span> Max Mercy, had evidence which, if it were made public, would hurt Hobbkus even more than this scandal. Perhaps Eddie would tell us the truth when he arrived.</span></p><p> </p><p align="center"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">11 days later, Friday night</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">There he was, <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>39</strong></span> Eddie R. Hobbkus (#9) in right field. It should be an exciting series. The Sox went 6-2 on the road trip and now had to win all three games against the Spoilers to pass the Cubs’ record of 116 wins in a season. Salinger told me before the first game of the series that Shoeless Joe had become more and more introverted while on the road. He hadn’t spoken to Sallinger at all on the trip and kept talking about not jinxing it when the other players made reference to the 117-win goal. Being <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>40</strong></span> outgoing himself, Sallinger simply couldn’t understand this type of behavior.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Apparently, someone said they thought it was unfair to bring Hobbkus to the team at such a late date, that he hadn’t earned the right to play for a championship team. The only thing Joe had to say, according to Salinger, was this: <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>41</strong></span> “Did you not agree that a championship would be the just reward for your labor? Am I not allowed to choose who will play and who will not? Or do you begrudge my generosity?” No one talked about Hobbkus’ 11th hour arrival after that.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">During the next three days I got to know Eddie Hobbkus’ pretty well. I started to talk to him during the first game while he was in right field, but he was in a different world when he played. I quit after the first inning. Instead, I met with him after the game.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Hobbkus told me the story of how he left to go to Chicago in 1933 with his friend Sam Simpson, and how he met Harriet Bird and how he drifted for 15 years, and how he almost threw the final game, but then something about his bat breaking. He was afraid of the publicity from the other story – the one Max Mercy would tell. I didn’t understand the whole explanation except that I could tell he was being sincere.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">The Sox won the first two games of the series 1-0 and 11-6. After the second game, Eddie hollered up to me that he better say his goodbyes now since he might not have a chance after the last game. I replied that, even so, there would be next year. He just kind of stared through me for a moment as though I weren’t there.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">“I’m not completely innocent, you know.” he said, wiping some dirt off his knees. “I’ll never be completely free of the past. What discourages me is that <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>42</strong></span> I could have been the best – the best there ever was – the best there ever will be. I still hope to be good, but I know I’ll never be great. So long Ray Kinsella.” “So long Eddie Hobbkus.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Hobbkus turned one last time and said, “It’s not really Hobbkus. My dad nicknamed me that because one day he hit a line drive off my leg when I was pitching to him. I hobbled around for a week while he had a big smile on his face. He knew he had hurt my spirit more than my body. It was getting to where I could strike him out nine times out of 10, so this was his last moment of glory before the <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>43</strong></span> son replaced the father.” Suddenly, he took off in a sprint toward right field.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">“What <em>is</em> your last name?” I hollered. But, he had already taken his place and there was no talking to him now.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">The tension was thick. You could cut it with a knife. There were <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>44</strong></span> 5,850 fans there to watch. I decided to try to get as many people as possible to the last game of the season and so I didn’t charge a cent. People were everywhere and cars were parked along the road for over a mile in both directions. I even heard a few people walked to the field from <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>45</strong></span> Dyersville – the nearby town. Everyone appreciated the gravity of the game. 116 wins had tied the Cubs’ record, but what self-respecting White Sox fan didn’t want to <em>beat</em> the Cubs?</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">The game was close. The Spoilers knew what was at stake and they didn’t want to be a footnote in baseball history. After four innings, the Sox trailed 3-1. We tied it up in the sixth where it stayed until the ninth. With two out and two on, the Spoilers’ best player, <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>46</strong></span> Harry Arndt, drove a rocket to the deepest part of left-center field. It looked for all the world the Spoilers were going to take the lead, but Joe Jackson managed to track it down only because of his incredible speed. And, that ended the threat.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">In the bottom of the inning, as so often seems to be the case, Shoeless Joe, the defensive hero of the top half the inning, led off. Fittingly, he drove a double down the line. <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>47</strong></span> Buck Weaver then grounded out, moving Joe to third. <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>48</strong></span> Happy Felsch struck out on three pitches. In the clean-up spot was Eddie Hobbkus. I couldn’t get over how intense he appeared. Sure it would be a big win, but… He let the count go to 2-1 before he blasted one to deep centerfield. The Spoilers’ centerfielder, <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>49</strong></span> Homer Smoot, turned and raced back, back, back. Smoot leaped as high as he could…</span></p><p style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"> </p><p style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"> </p><p style="text-align: center;" align="center" data-mce-style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;" data-mce-style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal;" data-mce-style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal;">CHAPTER 3 (1993)</span></strong></span></p><p><strong><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">﻿</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">“Daddy!”… “Daddy!

Wouldn’t that be something? They would <em>really</em> think I was a nut job then. Maybe I <em>am</em> a little crazy. I’ve been in love with baseball ever since I was a boy and played catch with my dad. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">When I was older, I used to feel like I had to include everyone in the game. When the girls wanted to play, I’d choose them for my team. When the boys, who played like girls, wanted to play, I’d choose them too. I admit it. I like to make others happy. I just wish there was a way to make everyone happy and build my baseball stadium at the same time, though not likely.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">“Daddy, come on!” I love to come out here - especially in the spring. I love to watch things grow. Look at Karin. She’s nine now. When I was her age, I had baseball cards of all the great players – Ruth, Hodges, Gehrig, DiMaggio. My friends and I used to put them in a hat and draw them out to make teams. Then, we’d play imaginary games. I would be the 1919 White Sox and they would be the 1925 Yankees or the 1955 Dodgers. I’d be anyone I wanted to be. I’d imagine anything I wanted. Why? Because I could. </span><br /> <br /><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;"> Even now, I would fantasize about being involved with the Black Sox – interviewing players, getting the real scoop about their guilt or innocence. I’d play games in my head, even seasons. Once I had the Sox winning 116 with just one to play. One more win for the record and then the Cubs would have to look <em>up</em> to the Sox. It doesn’t get any better than that. I see it often. I see it right now… bottom of the ninth, the crowd cheering, Hobbkus at the plate... a long fly ball... I guess I never grew out of the fantasy. All I know is that I love baseball and somehow baseball loves me.</span></p><p><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">&quot;DADDY!&quot;</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Walking into the house I saw Karin, Annie, Mark and my dad, John. He was pushing 80 now. Sometimes I reminisce about what it would have been like these last few years without my dad. When he left us, I was a young man. Mom told me he had died. I know she did it so that I wouldn’t feel like it was my fault that he left, but it happened while I had was traveling on my own after a bad exchange with him. I felt horrible that I never had a chance to tell dad that I loved him. Then, two years to the day after mom died, he showed up at the house. That was four years ago. After the shock, we welcomed him into our home and he’s been here ever since. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;">50</span></strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Sunday mornings were family time. At his advanced age, dad’s eyesight was poor and so we would read to him. The problem was that he could read the headlines himself in the newspaper and naturally, he wanted to know about every story. If ever there were proof that the headline did its job, it was with dad.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">He pointed to a headline – one by that sportswriter, Salinger. ‘You know how much I’ve liked him since he used the <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>51</strong></span> Kinsella name in that fictional piece about athletes playing for redemption.” I had to respond. “Dad, it isn’t like he meant you or me. A name is just a name.” I like Salinger alright I thought to myself, but sometimes his theories were a little farfetched. He was always trying to make something out of nothing – to make square pieces fit into round holes. But, then isn’t that what all sportswriters do?</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Yielding to the moment, I said to Mark “Well, don’t leave us in suspense. What has he got to say this week?” My brother-in-law had already read the piece so he decided that rather than read it out loud word-for-word, he would summarize it. That was okay with me. Although nobody told a story better than I could, Mark wasn’t bad.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">“The article is about the King – Ruth himself. Salinger claims he was digging through some old files in the late 40’s and discovered some unreported notes he had taken. He says that in 1965 he almost quit writing after they tore the <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>52</strong></span> Polo Grounds down. Out of disgust, he just threw a bunch of baseball notes into an old locker and just now discovered them.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">“He says that Babe Ruth really had two lives in baseball. His first was before 1920 and the second after that.” Annie interrupted. “Wasn’t 1920 Shoelesses’ last year.” I was about to educate her on pluralizing words that end in “s” when dad mumbled something about a “conspiracy”. Then, Mark managed to answer Annie’s question before I could say anything. “That it was”, Mark said with a gleam in his eye – proud to be the uncle of such a brilliant kid. After all, how many nine-year old girls know who Shoeless Joe was, much less what year was his last? Once his pride was fully satisfied, Mark went on. “The Black Sox managed to play another year together after they threw the 1919 World Series because there was no commissioner yet to suspend them. But, that’s not part of this story.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>53</strong></span> “1919 was also Salinger’s birth year in addition to Babe Ruth’s last year with the Red Sox. Some say, he not only cursed the Red Sox when he left in 1919, but that he had left his heart there as well.” I never figured there could be a real thing as a curse, but considering the White Sox threw the World Series in 1919 and the Bambino left the Red Sox in 1919… maybe there <em>was</em> such a thing as a curse - a &quot;Sox&quot; curse. After all, the White Sox won the WS in 1917, the Red Sox in 1918 and neither Sox team had won the World Series since! That’s 75 years, three quarters of a century!</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>54</strong></span> “He was a young man in 1919 and mostly known as a pitcher. Salinger goes on to say that Ruth was a very suspicious guy. He didn’t trust anyone in those later years with New York. This was strange because, in Boston, he had been everybody’s pal – always good for a laugh except when he had to sit in the dugout or the bullpen on days when he didn’t pitch. Had the designated hitter rule existed in those days, he might be considered the greatest pitcher of all time as well as hitter. Anyway, Salinger says that when he got traded to New York in 1920 a lot happened to him and he clamed up to the press.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">“Now that he could devote full time to hitting, he also began running faster.” I couldn’t resist, “Probably practice from running from all the muggers in New York”, I quipped. Just as quickly, I apologized for interrupting before Mark could accuse me of doing the very thing I hate the most. “Sorry, go ahead”.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">After a long pause in which Mark wouldn’t take his eyes off me… “Says he grew so weary of all the concrete in NYC that when he came to Yankee Stadium, he would take his shoes off and run in the outfield grass just to make him think he was back in the front yard of his home. The quote he has from Ruth was something to the effect of <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>55</strong></span> “the thrill of the grass”.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">Sensing he was done, Annie blurted “That kind of reminds me of Shoeless Joe”. I chimed in. “Dad, you used to talk about Shoeless Joe all the time when I was a kid – about him wanting to play again.” Dad just nodded approvingly. “Whatever happened to him?” asked Mark.</span></p><p><br /><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;"> Suddenly, a rush of energy overcame my dad and he couldn’t resist telling his own story. “After Jackson was banished from the Sox in 1920, he virtually disappeared from the face of the earth for almost three decades. Some accounts had him going back home to the hills of South Carolina and some to the Bronx. One legend had him traveling to the Himalayas.

Even at 79, he can still play catch and he still remembers the 1919 White Sox from when he was a five-year old kid – the same age as Karin was when she fell off the ladder helping me paint the house. That was the day after dad showed up. Karin almost died. Thankfully, Doc Gramm was helping us paint that day and he saved her life.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;">I still hear the voice sometimes when I’m out in the corn, but not as loud and not as often. I’m not quite as motivated to chase the dream as I was, say… four years ago when I came extremely close...

Although the original author of M*A*S*H more or less denies it, the facts strongly suggest Radar <em>was</em> patterened after Shaffer.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>23</strong></span> Walter dove back to the safety of the base <em>before</em> the lightning struck.

The back story is that Eddie died in the early spring of 1990 after the stadium had been built. To show respect, Ray and the other members of the Black Sox buried Eddie just outside the right field line and just beyond the edge of the cornfield. Eddie was never given the full redemption from the 1990 season because he was the blackest of the Black Sox – losing two 1919 World Series games as a pitcher, pitching ineffectively in a third and receiving the most crooked money from the fix. ﻿</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>25</strong></span> Hook, the dog, is named after Richard Hooker – the pen name for Richard Hornberger – the author of M*A*S*H. Hornberger was Shaffer’s colonel as well as being a surgeon in the Army during the Korean War at a M*A*S*H unit.

Salinger, the writer. In real life, he became a recluse. In the book Shoeless Joe (which Field of Dreams is based upon), the author W.P.

He was part of one of the most amazing games ever pitched. Ruth started a game against the Washington Senators. He walked the first batter and was promptly replaced on the mound by Ernie Shore. Shore got a double play and retired the next 25 batters. Despite retiring 27 batters without allowing a baserunner, it is not considered a perfect game as he did not start the game.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;" data-mce-style="font-family: verdana,geneva; font-size: 12pt; line-height: normal; color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>55</strong></span> The Thrill of the Grass is another baseball short story by W.P.
